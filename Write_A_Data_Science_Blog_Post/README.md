## Project Title: Analysis on Seattle Airbnb Listing data
This project demonstrates the analysis of Seattle Airbnb Listing data by using descriptive statistics and linear regression modeling.

## Getting Started
### Installation
This project runs with Python 3.7.6 64-bit in Jupyter Notebook. Several libraries are required to run this Notebook:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- IPython
- os
- seaborn
- sklearn

### Data
Data was provided by the course and can be downloaded from the compressed file under the same folder:
- calendar.csv: contains the availability and price
- listings.csv: includes all information available to describe the listing
- reviews.csv: some comments and reviews about the listing

## Motivation
As a loyal user of Airbnb, I am always wondering what contirbutes to the listing price on Airbnb website. In the future, I might consider listing my property (if I have any at that time) for guests to stay over. In order to maximize my profit, I would defintely need to do some research on what would increase the listing price. Therefore, this project serves as a great opportunities to take the data from Seattle as an example.


## Project conclusion/main findings
By the end of the analysis, I was able to answer three main questions that I am most interested in:
**1) What is the most expensive month to book accomodation in Seattle?**

    It is generally the most expensive to book accomodation through Airbnb during the summer time, in particular, August, July and June. It is cheapest to book in winter.

**2) Does availability contribute to the price?**

    In certain period of time, namely after 2016/07, the low availability contributes to the higher price.

**3) What contributes to a house listed with high price?**

    Number of bathrooms, number of people that can be accommodated, number of bedrooms, review_scores_value, review_scores_location.
